Some interesting points in this lab were the use of pointers over arrays, which I still don't feel comfortable using, but this lab helped me to introduce myself more on that point.
One of the difficulties I found was the validation of a variable of type char; I had to implement a validation based on ASCII characters that I didn't know if it was optimal.
Another point that gave me trouble to solve was the use of a double pointer, to be used in the 2-dimensional array. T **arr is a double pointer to a T type object, where T is a template type. The double pointer **arr is used to dynamically allocate a 2D array.
