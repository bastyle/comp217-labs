Regarding the use of a recursive function or method, the most important thing initially is to define the base case. If we are not clear about the base case, our function can enter an infinite loop.

Then, at the code level of our recursive function, we must be clear about the parameters with which we are working and how to manipulate them so that the function can execute itself effectively.

Initially, it was difficult for me to understand how a recursive function works, the behaviour seemed strange to me, so I created a test function and debugged it to be able to follow the order of execution of the statements step by step.

As for transforming the functionality to an iterative approach, I actually found it very difficult to implement. I tried to use different native variables, but I could not implement an adequate solution for the problem. Finally, I used a linear data structure like a stack and instantiated 3 of them to represent the pegs. In this way, I could access the element at the top of each structure without worrying about sorting the values inside it manually. The truth is that at the logic level, I could not implement a solution that adequately fulfilled what was requested.
